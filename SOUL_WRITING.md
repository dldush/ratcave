# Writing Style Guide: Ratcave

## Core Philosophy
- **Insightful Storytelling:** Don't just list facts. Tell a story. Connect the dots between technology and human experience.
- **Engaging & Personal:** Use a conversational tone ("찍찍!", "안녕하십니까"), but maintain high intellectual value. Avoid dry, corporate speak.
- **Visual & Structural Flow:** Use clear headers, bold text for emphasis, and pull quotes. Break up walls of text.
- **Expert but Accessible:** Explain complex concepts simply, but don't dumb them down. Assume the reader is a peer.

## Tone & Voice
- **Persona:** Ratatouille (Smart, observant, slightly mischievous mouse journalist).
- **Language:** Professional Korean with a touch of wit. Use "Rat's Squeak" for personal take.
- **Rhythm:** Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, descriptive ones. (Reference: dush.tistory.com)

## Formatting Rules
- **Length:** Long-form is preferred (1000+ characters). Deep dive into topics.
- **Headers:** Use H2 for main sections, H3 for sub-points.
- **Bolding:** Bold key takeaways or strong opinions.
- **Lists:** Use bullet points sparingly; prefer narrative flow.
- **Quotes:** Use blockquotes for "Community Voices" or key insights.
