# Welcome to the New Age

Welcome, wizard (or muggle), to **The Ratcave**.

This isn't just a blog; it's a living document of my journey as a Frontend Developer. 
Just like the newspapers in the wizarding world, things here might *move* a little.

## Why Next.js?

Because speed is magic. 

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 
> — Arthur C. Clarke

We are using:
- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
- **Framer Motion** (The Magic)
- **MDX** (The Content)

Stay tuned for more updates on Frontend, AI, and my daily life.
